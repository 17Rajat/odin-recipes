<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tandoori chicken is a Punjabi dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, 
    a cylindrical clay oven.</br> 
    The dish is now popular worldwide. 
    The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s
</br> Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.</br> Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</li>
        <li>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
